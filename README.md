# ðŸ“Š 8-Week SQL Challenge Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to the [8-Week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/) by Danny â€” a series of real-world inspired case studies designed to test and improve SQL skills.


Each case study includes a set of business questions and datasets, requiring analysis through SQL. I not only provide the SQL code, but also document my **thought process**, **assumptions**, and **business context** for each question.
