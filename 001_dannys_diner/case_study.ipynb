    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîç Problem Breakdown\n",
    "- **Data Source**: The `sales` table records all transactions and contains `product_id`. The `menu` table provides the corresponding `product_name`.\n",
    "- **Join Needed**: Yes ‚Äî to map `product_id` to `product_name`, join `sales` with `menu`.\n",
    "- **Grouping**: Group by `product_id` or `product_name` to aggregate purchases per item.\n",
    "- **Aggregation**: Use `COUNT(product_id)` to calculate total purchases for each item.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß≠ Assumptions\n",
    "- Each row in `sales` represents a single unit of purchase (no quantity column exists).\n",
    "- All product IDs in `sales` exist in the `menu` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üõ† Approach & SQL Explanation\n",
    "To solve this, I grouped the `sales` data by `product_id` and counted how many times each product was purchased using `COUNT()`. I then joined the `menu` table to retrieve the product name.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Result Validation\n",
    "Manually checked:\n",
    "- `ramen` appeared 8 times in the `sales` table, which matched the result in the query output.\n",
    "- The item with the highest purchase count was returned correctly.\n",
